test results

Setup:

Preflight runs with no errors, preflight.sh creates the tables and copies files correctly.  Apache starts with no errors, redirects to the login page.

Step 1:
I had to manually enter information for roles and users into the database.  Create users are not functional at this point.

Step 2:
Facilites created with no errors.  Will not create facilities with repeated name, or fcode.

Step 3:
creates assets correctly.  Will not create the same asset twice.

Step 4:
Dispose asset rejects access to facilities officer correctly.  Disposes assets correctly

*Step 5:  Asset report works, but I think it should only display if the asset is there on the day specified.  The assets appear if they were there before or on the date specified.  So if I dispose an asset, it still appears if I select a date after the disposal date.  Meaning an asset that is not at a facility anymore appears in the asset report for that date.

*Step 6:
Properly rejects access to facilities officers.
Makes requests, but you can make a request for an asset to be transfered from a facility it was not located at.  Disposed assets can still be transferred.  

*Step 7:
Properly rejects access to Logistics officers.
Properly confirms and denies requests.
There should be a link on the dashboard for pending transfer requests.  Transfers are a little hard to read, might want to have less numbers.

*Step 8:
Properly rejects access to facilities officers.
Updated requests dissapear.
There should be a link on the dashboard for pending request updates.

Step 9:
Transfer report not neccessary here, but the link is not broken.
